Constrained Optimization: Point of Dispense distribution under large scale health emergencies
Strategic models have been implemented to respond to large-scale emergencies. Under the impact of COVID-19, a well-established healthcare system with preparedness and quick response has proved its necessity. Thus, a simulation of an effective pandemic preparedness significantly benefits the entire community should the COVID-19 pandemic persists or a future pandemic outbreak happens. Our model studies the construction of a medical countermeasure supply chain for Allegheny County that involves the pre-positioning of Point of Dispense (PODs), which serve as single dispatch medicine points to assigned localities. Using data from Allegheny Capital Budget Summary[1], Allegheny County Zip Code Boundaries[3], and POD sites[4], <b>we show the pre-positioning plan that minimizes the distance required to transfer medicines from hospitals to PODs and from neighborhoods </b> to the assigned POD.

We use Gurobi and Python to implement our model formulation.
